## Searching for a script or system on Linux (suspicious things 1)!!!
One of the ways to run a script or "system" on Linux is using the init.d file. If you're searching for something suspicious that has to do with systems, then just go 
```
ls -lah /etc/init.d/
```
-lah shows basically all of the recent modifications or history of the init.d file (a directory containing scripts for init states) out in a nice long list for you to peruse. 
-lah can also just generally be used for anything useful.
